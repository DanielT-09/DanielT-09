# Hello!
## My name is Dan, a 15-year-old student from the UK who has recently found a passion in programming.

- I am currently studying Computer Science for my GCSEs and will be continuing with the A level.
- Python is my current tool of choice and am experimenting with Visual Studio Code at the moment.

Have a nice day ✌️
